By default, the generated model class will be placed in the `app/Models` directory. You can customize the location by specifying the desired path as an argument when running the `make:model` command.

	- **Naming Conventions:**
Eloquent follows certain naming conventions for model classes. By default, the class name should be in the singular form of the associated table name. For example, if you have a `users` table, the corresponding model class should be named `User`.
However, if your table name deviates from the default convention, you can specify the table name by defining a `protected $table` property in your model. This allows you to match the model with the correct table.
It's worth noting that Laravel provides additional conventions for defining relationships between models based on naming conventions. For example, if you have a `User` model with a relationship to an `Order` model, Eloquent will assume that the foreign key column is `user_id`. These conventions simplify the relationship setup process.
 

- **Eloquent Model Conventions:**
When working with Eloquent models, it's important to understand the conventions that Eloquent follows. These conventions simplify the development process and help maintain consistency across your application. Here are some key conventions to consider:

	- **Table Name Convention:**
Eloquent assumes that the table name associated with a model is the plural form of the model's class name. For example, if you have a `User` model, Eloquent will assume the corresponding table name is `users`. This convention allows for seamless mapping between models and database tables.
You can customize the table name if it deviates from the default convention by defining a `protected $table` property in your model. This allows you to specify the exact table name associated with the model.
 
	 - **Primary Key Convention:**
By default, Eloquent assumes that the primary key column for a table is named id. This convention provides a consistent and predictable way to interact with model instances. However, there may be cases where you need to use a different column as the primary key.
To override the default primary key column, you can define a protected $primaryKey property in your model. This property should hold the name of the desired primary key column.

	- **Timestamps Convention:**
Eloquent provides automatic handling of `created_at` and `updated_at` columns for models. These columns store the timestamp of when a record was created and last updated, respectively. By default, Eloquent expects these columns to exist in the corresponding database table.
If you want to disable the automatic handling of timestamps for a model, you can set the `public $timestamps` property to `false`. This can be useful in scenarios where you don't need or want to track the creation and update timestamps.
Alternatively, if your table uses different column names for timestamps, you can customize them by defining `const CREATED_AT` and `const UPDATED_AT` constants in your model, specifying the names of the corresponding columns.



- **Retrieving Models:**
In Laravel's Eloquent, retrieving models from the database is flexible and convenient. Let's explore the key aspects of retrieving models:

	- **Retrieving All Models:**
To retrieve all records from a table, you can use the all() method provided by Eloquent. We'll discuss how to retrieve all models and iterate over the result to access individual records.

	- **Retrieving Single Models:**
Eloquent provides methods like `find()`, `first()`, and `firstOrFail()` to retrieve single models based on the primary key or specific conditions. We'll explore how to use these methods to fetch a single model from the database and handle scenarios where the model may not be found.

	- **Querying Models:**
Eloquent allows you to query models using various query methods like `where()`, `orWhere()`, `whereIn()`, etc. We'll discuss how to build queries with conditions to retrieve models that match specific criteria. You'll learn how to filter models based on attributes, relationships, and other conditions.

  

- **Inserting & Updating Models:**
In Laravel's Eloquent, inserting and updating models in the database is made simple and intuitive. Let's explore the key aspects of inserting and updating models:

	- **Creating New Models:**
You can create new model instances and save them to the database using the `create()` method. We'll discuss how to create new models, assign attributes, and persist them to the database. Additionally, we'll cover techniques for handling mass assignment and protecting against security vulnerabilities.

	- **Updating Existing Models:**
Eloquent provides various methods to update existing model instances in the database. We'll explore methods like `save()`, `update()`, and `fill()` to update individual attributes or perform bulk updates. We'll also discuss techniques for handling mass assignment securely.

	- **Mass Assignment:**
Mass assignment allows you to set multiple attributes of a model at once. However, it's important to ensure the security of your application by controlling which attributes can be mass-assigned. We'll cover how to define fillable and guarded attributes in your models to specify which attributes are allowed or restricted for mass assignment.



- **Relationships:**
In Laravel's Eloquent ORM, relationships play a crucial role in defining and working with data associations between models. In this topic, we'll delve into the world of relationships and explore their various aspects. Let's take a look at what we'll cover:

	- **Types of Relationships:**
Eloquent offers a range of relationship types to handle different scenarios in your application:
	- One-to-One: Discover how to define and work with one-to-one relationships, where a model is associated with another model in a one-to-one mapping.
    - One-to-Many: Learn about one-to-many relationships, where a model can have multiple related records in another model.
    - Many-to-Many: Explore many-to-many relationships, which involve multiple models being associated with multiple other models.
    
	- **Defining Relationships:**
In Eloquent, relationships are defined using specific methods within your model classes. We'll explore how to use methods like `belongsTo()`, `hasMany()`, `belongsToMany()`, and others to define and establish relationships between models. You'll learn the syntax and conventions for defining relationships, as well as how to leverage additional options and customization.

	- **Eager Loading:**
Eager loading is a performance optimization technique in Eloquent that helps reduce the number of database queries executed when working with relationships. We'll delve into eager loading and its benefits, allowing you to retrieve related data in an optimized manner. You'll learn how to eager load relationships using the `with()` method and improve the performance of your application.
