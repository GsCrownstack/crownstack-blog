# Level 0: Pre-Requisite

Before diving into Laravel, it's important to have a solid foundation in certain technologies and concepts. These pre-requisite topics will help you build the necessary skills and knowledge required for a successful Laravel journey. Let's explore each topic in more detail:

  

## Basics of HTML

HTML forms the backbone of web development. Understanding HTML is essential for creating the structure and content of web pages. Here are some additional points to consider:

  

- Learn the basic HTML tags, such as `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, and semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.

- Practice creating different types of elements, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.

- Familiarize yourself with HTML attributes and their usage, including class, id, href, src, and alt.

- Explore the concept of HTML5 and its new features, such as the `<canvas>` element or `<video>` element.
