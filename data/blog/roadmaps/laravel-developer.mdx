Eloquent follows certain naming conventions for model classes. By default, the class name should be in the singular form of the associated table name. For example, if you have a `users` table, the corresponding model class should be named `User`.
However, if your table name deviates from the default convention, you can specify the table name by defining a `protected $table` property in your model. This allows you to match the model with the correct table.
It's worth noting that Laravel provides additional conventions for defining relationships between models based on naming conventions. For example, if you have a `User` model with a relationship to an `Order` model, Eloquent will assume that the foreign key column is `user_id`. These conventions simplify the relationship setup process.
 

- **Eloquent Model Conventions:**
When working with Eloquent models, it's important to understand the conventions that Eloquent follows. These conventions simplify the development process and help maintain consistency across your application. Here are some key conventions to consider:

	- **Table Name Convention:**
Eloquent assumes that the table name associated with a model is the plural form of the model's class name. For example, if you have a `User` model, Eloquent will assume the corresponding table name is `users`. This convention allows for seamless mapping between models and database tables.
You can customize the table name if it deviates from the default convention by defining a `protected $table` property in your model. This allows you to specify the exact table name associated with the model.
 
	 - **Primary Key Convention:**
By default, Eloquent assumes that the primary key column for a table is named id. This convention provides a consistent and predictable way to interact with model instances. However, there may be cases where you need to use a different column as the primary key.
To override the default primary key column, you can define a protected $primaryKey property in your model. This property should hold the name of the desired primary key column.

	- **Timestamps Convention:**
Eloquent provides automatic handling of `created_at` and `updated_at` columns for models. These columns store the timestamp of when a record was created and last updated, respectively. By default, Eloquent expects these columns to exist in the corresponding database table.
If you want to disable the automatic handling of timestamps for a model, you can set the `public $timestamps` property to `false`. This can be useful in scenarios where you don't need or want to track the creation and update timestamps.
Alternatively, if your table uses different column names for timestamps, you can customize them by defining `const CREATED_AT` and `const UPDATED_AT` constants in your model, specifying the names of the corresponding columns.



- **Retrieving Models:**
In Laravel's Eloquent, retrieving models from the database is flexible and convenient. Let's explore the key aspects of retrieving models:

	- **Retrieving All Models:**
To retrieve all records from a table, you can use the all() method provided by Eloquent. We'll discuss how to retrieve all models and iterate over the result to access individual records.

	- **Retrieving Single Models:**
Eloquent provides methods like `find()`, `first()`, and `firstOrFail()` to retrieve single models based on the primary key or specific conditions. We'll explore how to use these methods to fetch a single model from the database and handle scenarios where the model may not be found.

	- **Querying Models:**
Eloquent allows you to query models using various query methods like `where()`, `orWhere()`, `whereIn()`, etc. We'll discuss how to build queries with conditions to retrieve models that match specific criteria. You'll learn how to filter models based on attributes, relationships, and other conditions.

  

- **Inserting & Updating Models:**
In Laravel's Eloquent, inserting and updating models in the database is made simple and intuitive. Let's explore the key aspects of inserting and updating models:

	- **Creating New Models:**
You can create new model instances and save them to the database using the `create()` method. We'll discuss how to create new models, assign attributes, and persist them to the database. Additionally, we'll cover techniques for handling mass assignment and protecting against security vulnerabilities.

	- **Updating Existing Models:**
Eloquent provides various methods to update existing model instances in the database. We'll explore methods like `save()`, `update()`, and `fill()` to update individual attributes or perform bulk updates. We'll also discuss techniques for handling mass assignment securely.

	- **Mass Assignment:**
Mass assignment allows you to set multiple attributes of a model at once. However, it's important to ensure the security of your application by controlling which attributes can be mass-assigned. We'll cover how to define fillable and guarded attributes in your models to specify which attributes are allowed or restricted for mass assignment.



- **Relationships:**
In Laravel's Eloquent ORM, relationships play a crucial role in defining and working with data associations between models. In this topic, we'll delve into the world of relationships and explore their various aspects. Let's take a look at what we'll cover:

	- **Types of Relationships:**
Eloquent offers a range of relationship types to handle different scenarios in your application:
	- One-to-One: Discover how to define and work with one-to-one relationships, where a model is associated with another model in a one-to-one mapping.
    - One-to-Many: Learn about one-to-many relationships, where a model can have multiple related records in another model.
    - Many-to-Many: Explore many-to-many relationships, which involve multiple models being associated with multiple other models.
    
	- **Defining Relationships:**
In Eloquent, relationships are defined using specific methods within your model classes. We'll explore how to use methods like `belongsTo()`, `hasMany()`, `belongsToMany()`, and others to define and establish relationships between models. You'll learn the syntax and conventions for defining relationships, as well as how to leverage additional options and customization.

	- **Eager Loading:**
Eager loading is a performance optimization technique in Eloquent that helps reduce the number of database queries executed when working with relationships. We'll delve into eager loading and its benefits, allowing you to retrieve related data in an optimized manner. You'll learn how to eager load relationships using the `with()` method and improve the performance of your application.

# Level 3: The Mid Level
Congratulations on progressing to Level 3: The Mid Level! In this phase of your Laravel journey, we'll delve into more advanced topics and techniques that will elevate your Laravel skills to the next level. Get ready to tackle complex concepts and explore powerful features that will enable you to build robust and scalable web applications with Laravel.

The roadmap for Level 3 includes the following topics:

## Routing Extra Features

- Route Caching:
Route caching is a performance optimization technique that can significantly improve the routing performance of your Laravel application. By caching your routes, Laravel can quickly retrieve the route information from a cached file instead of dynamically resolving the routes for each request. This results in faster route matching and improved overall application performance.
To enable route caching, you can use the `route:cache` Artisan command. This command will generate a cached file that contains all the route information for your application. It's important to note that any changes made to your routes will require you to regenerate the route cache.

-  Rate Limiting:
Rate limiting is a technique used to control the number of requests a user or IP address can make to your application within a specified time period. Laravel provides built-in support for rate limiting, allowing you to protect your application from abuse and ensure fair usage of your resources.
With Laravel's rate limiting feature, you can define rate limits for specific routes or groups of routes. You can set the maximum number of requests allowed within a certain time frame and customize the response when the rate limit is exceeded. This helps to prevent abuse, improve security, and maintain the performance of your application.

-  Invokable Controllers:
Invokable controllers provide a concise and convenient way to define controllers that only contain a single `__invoke` method. Instead of defining multiple action methods in your controller, you can define a single `__invoke` method that handles the logic for the controller.
By using invokable controllers, you can simplify your codebase and make it more expressive. It eliminates the need to define separate methods for each action and allows you to encapsulate the controller's functionality in a single method.

With these advanced routing features, you'll have more control and flexibility in defining routes, optimizing performance, and managing access to your application. Be sure to refer to the Laravel documentation for detailed explanations and examples of each topic.

## Database/Eloquent Extra Features

- **Model Observers:**
Model observers allow you to listen for specific events on your Eloquent models and perform actions or logic in response to those events. By using model observers, you can decouple the event logic from your models and keep your codebase more organized and maintainable.
With model observers, you can listen to events such as creating, created, updating, updated, deleting, deleted, and more. This enables you to perform tasks like sending notifications, updating related records, or performing any custom logic whenever these events occur on your models.

- **Raw Database Queries:**
While Laravel's Query Builder provides a convenient and expressive way to interact with databases, there may be situations where you need to write raw SQL queries. Laravel allows you to execute raw database queries directly when needed, giving you full control and flexibility.
By using raw database queries, you can leverage the power of SQL and execute complex queries, perform advanced joins, utilize database-specific functions, or work with features not directly supported by Laravel's Query Builder. However, it's important to use raw queries judiciously and be mindful of security considerations.

With these additional database and Eloquent features, you'll have more control and flexibility when working with your application's data layer. Make sure to refer to the Laravel documentation for detailed explanations and examples of each topic.

## Events & Listeners
Events and listeners are an integral part of Laravel's event-driven architecture, allowing you to decouple different parts of your application and respond to specific actions or occurrences. Here's an overview of events and listeners in Laravel:

- **Events:**
Events represent significant actions or occurrences that happen within your application. They act as signals to indicate that something important has happened and can be triggered from various parts of your code. For example, you can create an event to signal when a user registers, when a new post is created, or when an order is placed.
Events in Laravel are simple classes that typically extend the `Illuminate\Foundation\Events\Event` base class. They encapsulate the data associated with the event and provide a way to broadcast or notify other parts of the application about the event occurrence.

- **Listeners:**
Listeners are responsible for responding to events and performing specific actions when an event is fired. A listener listens for specific events and executes the defined logic when the event occurs. For example, you can create a listener to send a welcome email to a newly registered user, to update the search index when a post is created, or to generate a PDF invoice when an order is placed.
Listeners in Laravel are simple classes that implement the `Illuminate\Contracts\Events\Listener` interface or use the `Illuminate\Foundation\Bus\Dispatchable` trait. They define a handle method where you can write the logic that should be executed when the associated event is fired.

- **Event-Listener Binding:**
To connect events with their corresponding listeners, you need to define the bindings between them. This binding is typically done in an event service provider or within the `EventServiceProvider` class. You can specify which listeners should be associated with specific events, allowing Laravel to automatically dispatch events to their respective listeners when triggered.

- **Benefits of Events & Listeners:**
Using events and listeners in your Laravel application brings several benefits:

	- **Decoupling**: Events and listeners enable loose coupling between different parts of your application. Components can communicate with each other indirectly through events, reducing dependencies and making your code more modular and maintainable.
    
	-   **Flexibility**: Events and listeners provide a flexible and extensible way to introduce new functionalities or respond to specific events without modifying existing code. You can add or remove listeners easily to adapt your application's behavior based on changing requirements.
    
	-   **Reusability**: Listeners can be reused across multiple events, allowing you to encapsulate common logic in a single place. This promotes code reusability and reduces duplication.
    
	-   **Testability**: With events and listeners, you can easily write unit tests to verify the behavior of your listeners in isolation. You can mock events and assert that the listeners perform the expected actions when events are fired.

Events and listeners provide a powerful way to handle application events and implement event-driven functionality in your Laravel applications.

## Task Scheduling
Task scheduling in Laravel allows you to automate the execution of recurring tasks or commands at specified intervals. By using Laravel's built-in task scheduler, you can easily configure and manage your scheduled tasks within your Laravel application.
Here's how you can leverage task scheduling in Laravel:

-**Defining Scheduled Tasks:**
To define a scheduled task, you need to make use of the `schedule` method provided by the `Illuminate\Console\Scheduling\Schedule` class. Within the `schedule` method, you can define the frequency and the command or closure that should be executed.

```
    // Example: Running a command every day at 8:00 AM
	$schedule->command('your:command')->dailyAt('8:00');

	// Example: Executing a closure every hour
	$schedule->call(function () {
	
	    // Your task logic here
	
	})->hourly();
```

- **Task Frequency Options:**
Laravel provides several options to specify the frequency of your scheduled tasks:
	-   `cron`: Define the task execution using a cron expression.
	-   `everyMinute`: Run the task every minute.
	-   `everyFiveMinutes`: Run the task every five minutes.
	-   `everyTenMinutes`: Run the task every ten minutes.
	-   `hourly`: Run the task once every hour.
	-   `daily`: Run the task once every day.
	-   `dailyAt`: Run the task daily at a specific time.
	-   `twiceDaily`: Run the task twice a day.
	-   `weekly`: Run the task once a week.
	-   `monthly`: Run the task once a month.
	-   `yearly`: Run the task once a year.

- **Running the Scheduler:** 
To execute the scheduled tasks, you need to add an entry to your server's crontab. This entry should point to the `artisan` command with the `schedule:run` option.
	`    * * * * * php /path/to/your/project/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1	`
	The above entry will instruct the server to run the Laravel scheduler every minute.
	
- **Task Output and Logging:**
Laravel provides various methods to handle the output and logging of your scheduled tasks:
	-   `emailOutputTo`: Send the task output to a specified email address.
	-   `sendOutputTo`: Redirect the task output to a specified file.
	-   `appendOutputTo`: Append the task output to a specified file.
	-   `emailOnError`: Send an email if the task encounters an error.

	These methods allow you to monitor the execution and troubleshoot any issues with your scheduled tasks.

Task scheduling in Laravel enables you to automate repetitive tasks, such as data synchronization, cleanup, or notification sending. By using the Laravel task scheduler, you can improve the efficiency and reliability of your application.

## Caching
Caching is an essential technique in web development that helps improve the performance and response time of your Laravel applications. Laravel provides a powerful caching system that allows you to store frequently accessed data in a fast and efficient manner. Let's explore the caching capabilities in Laravel:

- **Cache Drivers:**
Laravel supports various cache drivers out of the box, including:
	-   **File**: Stores cached data in files on the filesystem.
	-   **Database**: Stores cached data in a database table.
	-   **Memcached / Redis**: Utilizes the Memcached or Redis caching systems for high-performance caching.
	-   **APC / APCu**: Uses the Alternative PHP Cache or APCu extension for caching.
You can easily configure the cache driver in your Laravel application's configuration file (`config/cache.php`).

- **Caching Basics:**
To store data in the cache, you can make use of the `Cache` facade provided by Laravel. Here are some common caching operations:
	-   **Storing Data**: Use the `put` or `remember` methods to store data in the cache.
	- **Retrieving Data**: Use the `get` method to retrieve data from the cache.
	- **Checking Existence**: Use the `has` method to check if a key exists in the cache.
	- **Removing Data**: Use the `forget` method to remove data from the cache.

- **Cache Tags:**
Laravel also supports cache tags, which allow you to group related cache items together. You can assign tags to cached data and perform operations on specific groups of cached items. This provides more granular control over cache management.

- **Cache Configuration and Drivers:**
To configure cache settings and specify the cache driver, you can modify the `config/cache.php` file in your Laravel application. This file contains various configuration options and allows you to customize caching behavior according to your requirements.

Caching is an effective technique for optimizing the performance of your Laravel applications. By utilizing Laravel's caching system and choosing the appropriate cache driver, you can significantly improve the response time and scalability of your application.

## Laravel HTTP Client and Guzzle
Laravel provides a robust and expressive HTTP client that allows you to make HTTP requests to external APIs or services with ease. The HTTP client is built on top of the popular Guzzle HTTP client library, offering a fluent and intuitive API for handling HTTP requests and responses. Let's explore the features and capabilities of the Laravel HTTP client and Guzzle:

- **Making HTTP Requests:**
You can use the Laravel HTTP client to send HTTP requests using various HTTP methods such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`. Here's an example of making a `GET` request:
`$response = Http::get('https://api.example.com/users');`
You can also include query parameters, headers, and request payloads as needed.

- **Handling Responses:**
The HTTP client provides convenient methods to access and manipulate the response received from the server. You can retrieve the response body, headers, status code, and more. Here's an example:
	```
    $response = Http::get('https://api.example.com/users');
    $body = $response->body();
    $headers = $response->headers();
    $status = $response->status();
	```

- **Sending JSON Requests:**
When sending JSON requests, you can use the withHeaders method to include the Content-Type header as application/json, and the withBody method to send JSON payload:
	```
	$response = Http::withHeaders([
	    'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
	    ])->withBody(json_encode($data), 'application/json')->post('https://api.example.com/users');
	```

- **Handling Exceptions:**
The HTTP client automatically throws exceptions for unsuccessful requests, such as when encountering network errors or receiving non-successful status codes. You can catch these exceptions and handle them accordingly:
	```
	try {
	    $response = Http::get('https://api.example.com/users');
    
    } catch (\Illuminate\Http\Client\RequestException $e) {
		// Handle request exception
	}
  	```

- **Guzzle Integration:**
Under the hood, the Laravel HTTP client utilizes the Guzzle HTTP client library, which provides advanced features and configuration options. You can access the underlying Guzzle client instance and customize it as desired:
	```
	$client = Http::getHttpClient(); // Get the underlying Guzzle client
		// Configure Guzzle client options
	$client->setDefaultOption('verify', false);
	
With the Guzzle integration, you can configure various aspects of the HTTP client, such as SSL verification, 	timeouts, request options, and more. Guzzle provides extensive documentation that covers advanced use cases and 	configuration options.

The Laravel HTTP client and its integration with Guzzle offer a convenient and powerful way to interact with external APIs and services. With its expressive API and seamless integration with Laravel, you can easily handle HTTP requests, manipulate responses, and build robust interactions with external systems.
