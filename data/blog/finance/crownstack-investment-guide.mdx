Before we talk about different types of investments, the first thing to know is why investments are needed? So apart from Savings, **Tax planning is one of the major reasons that can help you in reducing tax deduction at source (i.e. TDS) and thereby, increasing your in-hand or take-home salary.** The Income-tax Act, 1961 provides many deductions of your investments, savings and of some specified expenditures also that we will discuss in this document in more detail. But before that we need to know, Is the benefit of investment deductions available to all? The answer is No. **Individuals who are opting for the old regime of taxation are only eligible for these investment deductions**. Next point is, are the investments for tax planning necessary for all? **No, Individuals who are having CTC more than INR 5,50,000/- can take advantage by making tax-saving investments**. Reason is if you are having CTC of INR 5.5 lakh then after getting standard deduction of 50k, your taxable income will be 5 lakh and up to 5 lakh of taxable income, there is already no tax due to available rebate.

Let's start section-wise, what are those investments for which deduction can be claimed for tax savings, and how can you claim it. There are 2 basis on which deduction is available under different sections of the Act, like some sections allow deduction on the basis of actual payment that should be made in the current financial year, while other sections allow on the basis of accrual i.e. it will be allowed in the year to which it belongs to whether actually paid or not in that financial year.
